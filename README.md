    I’m Rashmi, Machine LearningEngineer,Code Mentor and currently Kaggle Competition Expert top 2%.


  -👀 Having started coding at an early age and also Having completed my Bachelor’s, I can say my interest in this field has only grown with time. 
  I gravitate more towards Deep learning & NLP. Working in the technology sector of various MNCs like Cisco & VMware, working with startup and also as 
  Freelancer has helped me gain relevant experience in the industry. As businesses today are becoming more inextricably linked with information technology, 
  I strive to utilize my expertise to bridge the gap between technology and business across various domains. My key interest lies solely in sharing my 
  technical expertise with people.I thoroughly enjoy tackling problems pertaining to technology and coming up with novel ideas.
